Shortcuts for MAC (the plus sign [+] just means and, it doesn't mean an actual plus sign) 

- To take a screenshot (whole screen) - cmd + shift + A
- To take a screenshot of just the program you want - shift + cmd + 4
- To right click on your mac, click with 2 fingers (this has to be set up in system preferences, trackpad. for me this was the defualt).
